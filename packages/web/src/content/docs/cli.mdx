The echoai CLI by default starts the [TUI](/docs/tui) when run without any arguments.

```bash
echoai
```

But it also accepts commands as documented on this page. This allows you to interact with echoai programmatically.

```bash
echoai run "Explain how closures work in JavaScript"
```



---

## Commands

The echoai CLI also has the following commands.

---

### agent

Manage agents for echoai.

```bash
echoai agent [command]
```

---

#### create

Create a new agent with custom configuration.

```bash
echoai agent create
```

This command will guide you through creating a new agent with a custom system prompt and tool configuration.

---

### auth

Command to manage credentials and login for providers.

```bash
echoai auth [command]
```

---

#### login

echoai is powered by the provider list at [Models.dev](https://models.dev), so you can use `echoai auth login` to configure API keys for any provider you'd like to use. This is stored in `~/.local/share/echoai/auth.json`.

```bash
echoai auth login
```

When echoai starts up it loads the providers from the credentials file. And if there are any keys defined in your environments or a `.env` file in your project.

---

#### list

Lists all the authenticated providers as stored in the credentials file.

```bash
echoai auth list
```

Or the short version.

```bash
echoai auth ls
```

---

#### logout

Logs you out of a provider by clearing it from the credentials file.

```bash
echoai auth logout
```

---

### github

Manage the GitHub agent for repository automation.

```bash
echoai github [command]
```

---

#### install

Install the GitHub agent in your repository.

```bash
echoai github install
```

This sets up the necessary GitHub Actions workflow and guides you through the configuration process. [Learn more](/docs/github).

---

#### run

Run the GitHub agent. This is typically used in GitHub Actions.

```bash
echoai github run
```

##### Flags

| Flag      | Description                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `--event` | GitHub mock event to run the agent for |
| `--token` | GitHub personal access token           |

---

### models

List all available models from configured providers.

```bash
echoai models
```

This command displays all models available across your configured providers in the format `provider/model`.

---

### run

Run echoai in non-interactive mode by passing a prompt directly.

```bash
echoai run [message..]
```

This is useful for scripting, automation, or when you want a quick answer without launching the full TUI. For example.

```bash "echoai run"
echoai run Explain the use of context in Go
```
